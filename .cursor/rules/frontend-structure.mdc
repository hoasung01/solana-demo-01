# Frontend Application Structure

The frontend is built using Next.js and follows a modern React application structure.

## Directory Structure

- `src/app/` - Contains the main application routes and pages
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and shared code

## Key Components

The application includes several key components for interacting with the Solana blockchain:
- Wallet connection
- Staking interface
- Pool management
- Transaction handling

## Development Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for all new components and functions
2. Follow the existing component structure in `src/components/`
3. Place shared utilities in `src/lib/`
4. Use the Next.js app router for new pages and routes

## Configuration

The application uses several configuration files:
- [next.config.js](mdc:next.config.js) - Next.js configuration
- [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json) - TypeScript settings
- [components.json](mdc:components.json) - Component configuration
